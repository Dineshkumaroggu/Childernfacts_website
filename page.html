        <h1>Here we go with facts of children</h1>
       <ul >
         <li>Babies and kids can laugh up to 300 times a day. Adults typically laugh at most, about 20 times a day. Time to get more in touch with that inner child, and really enjoy life like the little ones.</li>
         <li>Babies are actually born a little underdeveloped when delivered. This is because there is only so much room in a woman’s womb. So, the first weeks of a newborn’s life, are kind of considered a ‘fourth trimester.</li>
        <li>A baby is aware of everything around them and tried to process it all as one. An adult’s brain consciously focuses on specific things, ignoring background noise. It has been suggested that creative people have managed to think more like an infant. Peter Pan was onto something.</li>
        <li>Some biologists think that newborns have that shrill and annoying cry, not only to call for attention but also so parents won’t get too attached. This comes from a the belief that infant mortality was much more common during the development of our species.</li>
        <li>Parents who speak to their babies often, typically know 300 more words than their peers, by the age of 2 years old. May the grooming for a spelling bee champion or talk show host begin.</li>
        <li>Child development refers to the changes that occur as a child grows and develops in relation to being physically healthy, mentally alert, and emotionally and socially healthy</li>
        <li>Some scientists believe that infants’ rapid brain growth mirror the changes that have been shaped over eons of evolution</li>
        <li>A baby is cute according to what scientists have labeled as a “baby schema.” This schema is a set of features that include a rounded head, large eyes, protruding cheeks, a big forehead, round body, and soft surfaces</li>
        <li>Researchers note that a baby’s brain is like a lantern: it is vaguely aware of everything. An adult’s brain, on the other hand, is more like a flashlight, consciously focused on specific things but ignoring background. Scientists suggest that creative people have retained some ability to think like an infant.</li>
        <li>Scientists believe that humans are evolutionarily programmed to find babies cute to ensure that babies are cared for, even through restless nights and bouts of colic</li>
        <li>Evolutionary biologists suggest that newborns are born with an annoying cry so that parents won’t get too emotionally attached while the baby still has a high chance of dying. Additionally, crying gets the attention a baby needs to survive.</li>
        <li>Parents typically respond to 50%–60% of a baby’s vocalization. However, language development could be sped up if parents responded to a baby’s vocalization 80% of the time. Beyond that, learning declines</li>
        <li>Researchers note that babies may cry with the intonations of their mother tongue</li>
        <li>Trauma or exposure to toxins during the prenatal period can impact later childhood development. Some dangers include prenatal exposure to drugs, toxins, and disease</li>
        <li>Childhood development depends on the interaction between genes and environmental variables. For example, a child may have the genes to grow tall, but if it doesn’t have the proper nutrition, it may never achieve full height.</li>
        <li>The development of language occurs in four stages: 1) babbling stage, 2) single-word stage, 3) two-word stage, and 4) multi-word stage</li>
        <li>Researchers suggest that the majority of parents fall within one of four different parenting styles: 1) authoritarian, 2) authoritative (which is more democratic than authoritarian, 3) permissive, and 4) uninvolved parenting. Of these four, authoritative parenting tends to result in children who are more happy, capable, and successful</li>
        <li>While all children grow and develop in similar patterns, each child develops at his or her own pace</li>
        <li>The first five—and especially the first three years—of a child’s life are the most important. They shape the brain’s organization, development, and functioning throughout life.</li>
        <li>Permissive parenting tends to result in children who rank low in happiness and self-regulation. They are more likely to experience problems with authority and perform poorly in school</li>
        <li>There are four different types of development milestones for children: 1) physical (large- and fine-motor kills), 2) cognitive (ability to think, learn, and solve problems), 3) social and emotional (understanding of their own and others’ emotions), and 4) communication milestones (both linguistic and nonverbal communication)</li>
        <li>The most common type of developmental delay in children is language and speech problems. Speech refers to verbal expression, such as the way words are formed. Language is more broad and includes expressing and receiving information, such as understanding gestures</li>
        <li>Common causes of social and emotional developmental delays include autism, Asperger syndrome, and childhood disintegrative disorder. Some early signs of autism includes lack of eye contact, refusal to cuddle, and apathy toward parents or caregivers</li>
        <li>Infant educational television does not promote intellectual development, because infants respond to things that respond to them. Even the most advanced DVD does not respond to the specific cues of an infant. Playing with a baby is far more valuable than even the most expensive system of videos</li>
        <li>Studies show that children do best when they have at least three loving and supportive adult influences in their lives</li>
        <li>Children who watch more than three hours of television, videos, or DVDs a day have a higher chance of conduct problems, emotional symptoms, and relationship problems by the time they are 7 than children who do not</li>   
        <li>Studies show that corporal punishment can hinder intellectual development. In other words, there is a marked correlation between spanking and a lowered IQ</li>   
        <li>Maternal stress can affect fetal development, including an increased chance of cleft palate, depression, attention deficits, and distractibility. Stress hormones released by the mother can also reduce the placenta’s ability to protect the fetus from stress hormones in the future</li>   
        <li>One of the biggest threats to a developing fetus is maternal malnutrition, whether caused by famine, poverty, or dieting.</li>
